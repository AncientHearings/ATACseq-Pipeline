 #Bioconda is put first. Then, conda-forge .
 #Reason 
 #1. Provides pre-built bioinformatics tools like samtools, which avoids the need to build them manually. 
 #2. Any lower-level dependencies required by these tools are 'typcially' found in conda-forga, which is newer and better maintained. Lower-level dependencies mean supporting dependenices that the main tool needs in order to run.
 #3. Putting Bioconda first ensures tools install cleanly, while conda-forge fills in the supporting libraries. 
     #Cleanly means that the tool is stable, reliable and complete- all the components come together without conflicts or missing parts. 
     #samtools call htslib to parse the SAME, encode it as BAM an dcompress using zlib.
